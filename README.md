# 🌍 Global Mobility Application Analyzer (Visa Approval Prediction System)

An end-to-end Machine Learning and MLOps project that predicts whether a visa application is likely to be **Certified** or **Denied** using historical immigration application data.

The project combines **Machine Learning, MLOps, Cloud Deployment, CI/CD Automation, and FastAPI** to build a production-ready visa approval prediction system.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Visa approval decisions depend on multiple applicant and employer-related factors such as:

* Education Level
* Work Experience
* Prevailing Wage
* Company Size
* Company Age
* Region of Employment
* Job Training Requirements
* Employment Type

Manually evaluating large numbers of visa applications can be time-consuming and difficult to scale.

This project leverages Machine Learning to automate the prediction process and provide real-time visa approval predictions through a web application.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict whether a visa application will be **Certified** or **Denied**
* Automate visa application screening
* Build a complete ML pipeline from data ingestion to deployment
* Implement MLOps practices for model monitoring and deployment
* Deploy the application on AWS Cloud
* Enable real-time predictions through a FastAPI web application
